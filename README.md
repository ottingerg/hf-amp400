# hf-amp400

HF-Amp400 is controllerboard designed to controll the gate biasing and output power of 2 double HF-AMP FETs. 

It therefore provides 4 channels of gate biasing

4 channels of HF-Power mesaurement 

2 resetable fuses up to 10A and one auxilary resetable fuse controll for even higher currents.

This project was done as collaberation between

it is Open Source Hardware licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0 and is based on EtherDue which itself is based on Arduino Due



# EtherDue

The EtherDue is an 100% Arduino Due compatible board with onboard Ethernet.

For full details about the EtherDue, including a getting started guide, please visit the [Freetronics EtherDue product page](http://www.freetronics.com/products/etherdue-arduino-due-compatible-with-onboard-ethernet).

Design files were produced with [Kicad](http://kicad.org). A [PDF of the schematic is available](https://github.com/freetronics/EtherDue/raw/master/EtherDue.pdf).
